## Code Files
The code files are currently private as the corresponding research paper in ACM MM is under review. They will be made publically available soon after the paper is published/accepted for publication.

Dataset Access
--------------
Access to the ‘IIT Roorkee Multimodal Emotion Recognition (IIT-R MMEmoRec) dataset’ can be obtained by through [`Access Form - IIT-R MMEmoRec Dataset.pdf`][2]. The dataset is prepared by Puneet Kumar and Sarthak Malik at Machine Intelligence Lab, IIT Roorkee under the supervision of Prof. Balasubramanian Raman. It contains speech utterances, corresponding images and emotion labels (happy, sad, hate, anger).
